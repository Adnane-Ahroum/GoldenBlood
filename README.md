# GoldenBlood ü©∏

## 1. Overview

GoldenBlood is a comprehensive web-based blood donation and sales management system designed to streamline the entire blood transfusion ecosystem. The platform serves as a bridge between blood donors, recipients, and blood banks, facilitating secure blood transactions while maintaining an efficient inventory management system.

## 2. Motivation & Impact

The healthcare industry faces critical challenges in blood supply management, including:
- Inefficient tracking of blood donations and inventory
- Lack of transparency in the blood supply chain
- Time-consuming manual processes for donor-recipient matching
- Limited accessibility to real-time blood availability information

GoldenBlood addresses these challenges by providing a digital solution that:
- **Saves Lives**: Connects donors with recipients faster, reducing response time in emergencies
- **Enhances Transparency**: Provides real-time visibility into blood stock levels and donation history
- **Improves Efficiency**: Automates donor registration, blood typing, and inventory management
- **Ensures Safety**: Implements rigorous data validation and secure transaction protocols

## 3. How It Works

### Process Flow

**For Donors:**
1. Register and create a donor profile with blood type information
2. Schedule donation appointments through the platform
3. Receive notifications about donation opportunities and urgent needs
4. Track donation history and contribution impact

**For Recipients:**
1. Submit blood requests with specific requirements (blood type, quantity)
2. Search available blood inventory in real-time
3. Process secure transactions for blood procurement
4. Receive status updates on request fulfillment

**For Administrators:**
1. Manage donor and recipient databases
2. Monitor and update blood stock levels
3. Process and approve blood transactions
4. Generate reports on donation trends and inventory analytics

### Data Management

- **Donor Management**: Comprehensive profiles including blood type, contact information, donation history, and eligibility status
- **Recipient Management**: Request tracking, blood type matching, and transaction history
- **Stock Management**: Real-time inventory tracking with automated alerts for low stock levels, expiration date monitoring, and blood type distribution
- **Transaction Records**: Complete audit trail of all blood donations, sales, and transfers with timestamps and user accountability

## 6. Setup & Installation Walkthrough

### Prerequisites

```bash
Node.js >= 18.0.0
npm or yarn
PostgreSQL or MySQL database
Git
```

### Step-by-Step Installation

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adnane-Ahroum/GoldenBlood.git
cd GoldenBlood
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

**3. Environment Configuration**

Copy the example environment file and configure your variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/goldenblood"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"

# Email Configuration (optional)
EMAIL_SERVER="smtp://username:password@smtp.example.com:587"
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@goldenblood.com"
```

**4. Database Setup**

Generate Prisma client and run migrations:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Seed the database (optional):

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

**5. Run Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

**6. Build for Production**

```bash
npm run build
npm start
# or
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: Verify your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` is correct
- **Port Already in Use**: Change the port using `PORT=3001 npm run dev`
- **Prisma Errors**: Try `npx prisma generate` and restart the dev server
